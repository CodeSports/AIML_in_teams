___See the complete description along with DEMO @ Youtube___  https://youtu.be/1y9UH3Jkhqw 

_A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) and M.L. (Machine Learning) are touching each and every aspect of our lives today and the way we work in our agile and scrum teams is NOT an exception to this._

_Yes, It's possible today to use A.I. and M.L. into our day to day working where they can predict and project things which earlier could have been done only by humans._

_Things like Estimations and Planning are the places where we can use the power of A.I. and M.L. This repo contains a couple of demonstration of how this can be done_
